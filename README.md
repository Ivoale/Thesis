# Thesis
Thesis code files of Matlab, Python and Arduino for the "Touch Type Discrimination Using Artificial Whiskers" project.
The Matlab files have the pre-processing of the raw data, the neural network training and testing sets.
The Python files developed by Jonathon Taufatofua get the data from the whiskers' sensors.
The Arduino file has the code for the pan/tilt motor, where the angles and durations of each touch type are presented.
The respective .csv files contain the raw datas from the experiments.
